The above ino file is for the arduino uno 
Its design was  written to drive an lcd display  with keypad actuator Typically this would be an application you would sue for  vehicle  security , electronic door entry systems , electronic safes or perhaps some other requirement that you would typcally require some form of keypad pass You could even use this as a signing on method for access to computers and other attached eqquipments shed alarms , garage alarms and so forth requiring some form of protected entry 
You can change the pass word on this and  it has its own menu so that you can access these functions functions 
It is slightly buggy and I need to do some more work on this at some point but its 95%  all in working order 
Enjoy
