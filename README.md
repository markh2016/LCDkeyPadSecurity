The ino file is for the arduino uno Its design was written to drive an lcd display with keypad actuator Typically this would be an application you would use for vehicle security , electronic door entry systems , electronic safes or perhaps some other requirement that you would typically require some form of keypad pass

You could even use this as a signing on method for access to computers and other attached equipment , shed alarms , garage alarms , bike alarms even household alarms and so forth requiring some form of protected entry

You can change the pass word to your choice and it has its own menu so that you can access these functions functions

It is slightly buggy and I need to do some more work on this at some point but its 95% all in working order thus far
